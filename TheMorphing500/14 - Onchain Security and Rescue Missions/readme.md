Losing custody of your wallet can be disastrous.

If you get phished by hackers, you almost don’t realize it until the process is completed due to the subtlety.

Many victims lose hope but thanks to on-chain rescue teams, some of them have been able to find help.

How? Read on ⬇️

[RescuETH](https://x.com/ourRescuETH/status/1753663348464636248) is one of those teams and they have had quite a run since their official operations began in February 2024.

They have wrestled with hackers, rescued victims and recovered over $1.2 million in assets from the crypto dark forest!

RescuETH is built by the team [@WTFAcademy_](https://x.com/WTFAcademy_) and their rescue missions are powered by Flashbots ⚡, a system that provides a secure way to move assets from a compromised wallet to a new, secure one.

## "How do they achieve this?"

‘’It is a race against the hackers.’’ says [@0xAA_Science](https://x.com/0xAA_Science), a core member at [@ourRescuETH](https://x.com/ourRescuETH/status/1753663348464636248)

When users discover unauthorized access or transfers, they contact the team with transaction details, which are then analyzed for recovery efforts.

According to the Q2 2024 report by one of their collaborators, [@slowmist_team](https://x.com/SlowMist_Team), the top 3 ways wallets get exploited are:

🎣 Private key leaks
🎣 Phishing
🎣 HoneyPot Scams

During exploitation analysis, users whose assets haven't been transferred have a higher chance of regaining asset custody. 

As [@0xAA_Science](https://x.com/0xAA_Science) once responded to a victim, "If your assets are already transferred, there is almost no hope."

In June 2024, they open-sourced two Paymaster contracts used in a rescue mission during the [@zkysync](https://x.com/zkysync) airdrop. 

During this rescue mission, they were able to recover nearly 840,000 $ZK from hundreds of stolen wallets.

Check out the paymaster contracts [here.](https://x.com/ourRescuETH/status/1804901647350657063)

Some other assets they have been able to recover include $ETH, $MOBY, $USDe, $ENA, $CQT, $ATOM, $DYM, and $BLAST, to mention a few. 

Their work continues to grow and they are currently in partnership with [@OKLink](https://x.com/OKLink) to further amplify and strengthen asset security on Web3 💪

## Some tips to avoid wallet exploitation:

📌 Use trusted software wallets that have high resistance to breach and backup your mnemonics (12 seed phrase) in a secure location.

Some choose pen and paper, others use a metal backup. Choose your preferred method.

📌 Beware of clicking spam links, websites and downloading apps from unauthorised sources. Some come in the guise of offering you a job; red flag! 🚩

📌 DYOR to avoid investing in HoneyPot scams because once you invest, there is no way out. Avoid being an exit liquidity! 🫵

That said, if you or someone you know fall victim, quickly reach out to the team [RescuETH](https://x.com/ourRescuETH/status/1753663348464636248) for help!

STAY SAFU! 🤝
