Have you ever wondered how you get ads and pop-ups of products and services you talk about when you scroll through the internet? It’s almost as if your phone can hear you. In fact, they can, and this is achieved by gathering data from various sources, including your online searches, social media interactions, and demographic information.

Large technology companies, including FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google), collect and use user data for various purposes, including selling to owners of products and services. When you place an “ad’, you’re essentially asking any of these companies to place your product or services in front of those who are interested in it.

So, when you talk about buying anything (from hair products to accessories etc.) and scroll through - for example- Instagram, you get pop-ups of the said product. It’s not a miracle, it’s just tech. This is because Instagram has gathered that you want this product and because someone who sells this product placed an “ad” on Instagram, they match you both together. Sometimes, it comes in handy. Most times, it’s very concerning.

Everything explained above can be summed up into one word; CENTRALIZATION. Instagram has the autonomy to do this match-making because they have access to and control the data of everyone on the app.

# What makes Web3 special is DE-CENTRALIZATION.

Web3 applications are built on a system where not only the founders have autonomy, but ownership and control is distributed across the platform and shared with the users. The system that allows this is the Blockchain network. 

The blockchain network is a de-centralized network used to create decentralized applications and platforms that allow users to interact and transact with each other without relying on centralized intermediaries. This means users can have greater control over their data, digital assets, and online identities, enhancing privacy and security.

Some of the ways these are achieved are: 

- Decentralized Storage: In Web3, user data is often stored on decentralized storage platforms like the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) or decentralized storage networks like Filecoin. These platforms ensure that data is not stored on a single centralized server controlled by a corporation, making it more challenging for companies to collect and monetize user data without consent.

- Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI): Web3 emphasizes self-sovereign identity, where users control their digital identities and the information associated with them. Users can decide which aspects of their identity to share and with whom, giving them more control over their personal data and how it is shared.

- Consent-Based Data Sharing: With the help of blockchain technology and smart contracts, users can have more control over who can access their data and under what conditions. This enables consent-based data sharing, where users must explicitly agree to share their data before it can be accessed.

Although not perfect, the impact of Web3 is already evident in various industries, such as finance (DeFi), digital art (NFTs), and gaming, by fostering innovation and empowering users. 

That’ll be all for today. See you in the next one!
