Airdropping is one of the ways to receive free money (in form of cryptocurrency) in Web3 

If you’re reading this, there is a high chance that at one moment or the other, someone (a friend, maybe) has told you how to get free cryptocurrency by receiving airdrops. They most likely would have also added ‘’It will only take a few simple tasks and you’ll have it in your wallet”. 

How true is this? Let’s find out.

Have you ever tried to download a free e-book and you were required to input your email at a section? You input your email and in a second, you get the e-book. That’s exactly what airdropping is. 

Your email address = free e-book. 

Same thing applies to getting free cryptocurrencies. The task (e.g., inputting your email address) may vary from one airdrop to another but the goal is the same. 

A crypto airdrop is a system of distributing tokens/coins to people for free.

Some of the tasks you’re required to do includes joining a discord/telegram channel, liking a tweet and retweeting, watching a YouTube video, signing up for a newsletter, a referral contest, etcetera. They require you to do basic stuff and at the end, you get your free crypto. 

Remember, they are currencies, and they have value. So, why would anyone want to give out so much to so many people for free?

Using the free e-book illustration, why would I want to give out all the energy I put into writing and designing an e-book for free? 

It’s simple: I need your email address. 

Why would you be willing to input your email for a free e-book? 

It’s also simple, you seek knowledge. 

## So, why would anyone want to give out valuable airdrops (for free)?

This would bring us to a classification of airdrops.

- Bounty Airdrop

This is the most common type of airdrop. If a project is up and coming and the owners want the publicity to go through the roof, they employ this type of airdrop.

You’re simply asked to carry out a few of the aforementioned tasks with a small incentive in the form of cryptocurrency. The more people talk about the project (in form of tweets and retweets), the more people know about the project and the more likely the project goes through the roof!

- Exclusive Airdrop

As the name implies, exclusive; meaning it is only available to a community of crypto holders/owners. 

For instance, if I have a crypto community of a million member, I can launch an exclusive airdrop for my members alone. This keeps my community engaged and also entices other people to join. It can also stir them to always look ahead for upcoming projects.

- Governance Airdrop

This kind of airdrop gives you the stage to roll with the big boys in a project. It gives users the rights to contribute on key decisions for the project and gives them an opportunity to be directly involved in its future direction.

The main goal of this airdrop is decentralization: users control how the project is run rather than relying on a central authority.

Endnote:

Airdrops are not to be dreaded. They are a great way to get free money but be sure not to disclose any information that could be used to scam you. Do your research and ask questions if you have any doubts ;)
