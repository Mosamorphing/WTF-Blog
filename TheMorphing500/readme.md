Hi there, welcome! 

This publication starts with already published pieces between July 2022 - July 2023. I'd started learning about Web3 and it was a way of documenting my findings in an easy-to-understand manner within 500 words. 

If you know enough about blockchain and web3, you may ignore this as it best serves beginners. Subsequently, more topics will be added in the same easy-to-understand manner.
